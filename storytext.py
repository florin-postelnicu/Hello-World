       'Indeed, every creature with fins and a tail was in distress, ' \
       'for the king of the fishes was suffering with a dreadful pain' \
       ' in his mouth. It had come about in this way. ' \
       'One day while swimming around in the waters outside his palace,' \
       ' the king of the fishes saw something hanging in the water ' \
       'that looked as if it were good to eat. So at once His Majesty' \
       ' gulped it down, when, oh horrors! he found he had barely' \
       ' escaped swallowing a fish hook, which stuck fast in his gills.' \
       'It had been baited by some fishermen up in a boat on the sea top.' \
       ' When the king of the fishes found the dreadful thing in his ' \
       'mouth, he jerked himself away.' \
       'The line broke but the hook remained, giving the king a fever and' \
       ' much pain. How to get the iron out and heal His Majesty was' \
       ' now the question. All the wise creatures in the ocean, from' \
       ' the turtle to the gudgeon and from the tittleback to the whale,' \
       ' were summoned to the palace to see what could be done. ' \
       'Many a sage noddle was bent, and eye blinked and fin wagged,' \
       ' as the marine doctors talked the matter over in the council. ' \
       'The turtle was considered the most learned and erpert of them' \
       ' all. Many were his feelings of the king’s pulse and his lookings' \
       ' down into his throat, before Dr. Turtle would pronounce what' \
       ' was the real trouble or write a prescription for his patient.' \
       'Finally, after consultation with the other doctors that had fins ' \
       'and tails, or were in scales and shell, it was decided that ' \
       'nothing less than a poultice made of rabbits’ eyes would loosen' \
       ' the hook and end His Majesty’s troubles. So Dr. Turtle' \
       ' was ordered to go to the seashore and invite a rabbit to come ' \
       'down into the world under the sea, that they might make a' \
       ' poultice of his eyes and apply the warm mess to the king’s' \
       ' throat. Arriving on the sea beach, at the foot of a high hill.' \
       ' Dr. Turtle, looking far up, found Mr. Rabbit out of his burrow ' \
       'and taking a promenade along the edge of the forest.' \
       ' Forthwith Dr. Turtle waddled across the beach and part way up ' \
       'the hill, climbing hard, until he began to puff and blow. ' \
       'He had enough breath left, however, to salute Brother Bunny' \
       ' with a good morning. Very politely the rabbit returned the ' \
       'greeting.“It’s a hot day,” said Dr. Turtle, as he pulled out his' \
       ' handkerchief, wiped his horny forehead, and cleaned the sand ' \
       'out of his claws.“Yes, but the scenery is so fine. Dr. Turtle,' \
       ' that you must be glad you’re out of the water to see such lovely' \
       ' mountains. Don’t you think Korea is a fine country ?' \
       ' There is no land in the world so beautiful as ours. ' \
       'The mountains, the rivers, the seashore, the forests,' \
       ' the flow-ers ” If Dr. Turtle had let the rabbit run on, ' \
       'praising his own country, he would have for- gotten his errand ; ' \
       'but, thinking of His Majesty, the suffering fish king,' \
       ' with the cruel hook in his mouth. Dr. Turtle interrupted Bunny, ' \
       'saying : ” Oh, yes. Brother Bunny, this view of the landscape' \
       ' and country is all very beautiful, but it can’t compare to ' \
       'the gems and jewels, trees and flowers, sweet odors' \
       ' and everything lovely down in the world under the sea.”' \
       ' At this, the rabbit pricked up his ears. It was all new to him.' \
       ' He had never heard that there was anything under the water but ' \
       'common fishes and seaweed and when these were decayed and' \
       ' washed up along the seashore — well, he had his ideas about' \
       ' them. They did not smell sweet at all. Now, he heard a' \
       ' differ- ent story. His curiosity was roused. ' \
       '“What you tell me, my friend, is interesting.' \
       ' Go on.” Thereupon Dr. Turtle proceeded to tell of most' \
       ' wonderful mountains and valleys down on the floor of' \
       ' the deep sea, with every kind of rare water plants,' \
       ' red, orange-color, green, blue, white, with trees' \
       ' of gold and silver, besides flowers of every color and' \
       ' delightful perfume, ” You surprise me,” said Brother Bunny, ' \
       'getting more interested. ” Yes, and all sorts of good things to eat' \
       ' and drink, with music and dancing, handsome serving maids ' \
       'and everything nice. Come along and be our guest. ' \
       'Our king has sent me to invite you.” ” May I go ? ” asked' \
       ' Brother Bunny, delighted. “Yes, at once. Get on my back and ' \
       'I’ll carry you.”So the rabbit ran and the turtle waddled to the' \
       ' water’s edge. ” Now hold fast to my front shell,” said Dr. Turtle ;' \
       ' ” we’re going under the water.” Down, down below the blue ' \
       'waves they sank until they arrived at the king’s palace.' \
       ' There the rabbit found everything was true, as told by the turtle.' \
       ' The colors, the rich gems were as he had said. Dr. Turtle ' \
       'introduced Brother Bunny to some of the princes and princesses ' \
       'of the kingdom and these showed their guest the sights and ' \
       'treasures of the palace, while Dr. Turtle attended the coun- cil of' \
       ' doctors to announce the success of his errand.' \
       ' But while Mr. Rabbit was enjoying himself, thinking this was ' \
       'the most wonderful place in the world, he overheard them talking' \
       '. Then he found out why they had brought him there and' \
       ' shown him such honors. Horrified at the idea of losing his eyes,' \
       ' he determined to save his sight and play the tortoise a smart' \
       ' trick. However, of this he told no one. So when he was politely ' \
       'informed by the royal executioners that he must give up his eyes' \
       ' to make the king well. Brother Bunny broke out with equally' \
       ' polite regrets: “Really, I am so sorry that His Majesty is ill,' \
       ' and you must excuse me that I cannot help him immediately, ' \
       'for the eyes I have in my head now are not real eyes, but only ' \
       'crystal. I was afraid that sea water would hurt my sight, so' \
       ' I took out my ordinary eyes, buried them in the sand and put on' \
       ' these crystal ones, which I usually wear in very dusty or wet' \
       ' weather.” At this the faces of the royal officers fell.' \
       ' How could they break the news to His Majesty and disappoint' \
       ' him? Brother Bunny seemed to be really sorry for them and spoke ' \
       'up.“Oh I don’t feel bad about it. If you will allow me to return to ' \
       'the beach, I’ll dig them up and return in time for the ' \
       'poultice-making,” said the rabbit. So, getting on Dr. Turtle’s back,' \
       ' Brother Bunny was soon out of the water and on land. ' \
       'In a jiffy he jumped off, scampered away, and reached the woods,' \
       ' showing only his cotton tail. Soon he was out of sight.' \
       ' Dr. Turtle shed tears and returned to tell how a rabbit' \
       ' had outwitted him.'
